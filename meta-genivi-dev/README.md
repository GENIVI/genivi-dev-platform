meta-genivi-dev: the Yocto layer for the GENIVI Development Platform
====================================================================

This layer defines a GENIVI Development Platform (GDP) image build. The layer
supports cross-architecture application development using QEMU emulation and
an SDK.

The layer is nowadays part of genivi-dev-platform repository and not
maintained in a separate repository because the intention is to keep only
GDP-unique things here, and to push all non-unique things to other locations.

Therefore, please refer to genivi-dev-platform project for further details.
