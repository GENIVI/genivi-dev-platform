Subject: [PATCH] Workaround crashes in QtQml code related to dead-store
 elimination

When compiled in release mode with GCC 6, QtQml may crash.
This is because the C++ compiler is more aggressive about dead-store
elimination in situations where a memory store to a location precedes
the construction of an object at that memory location.

The QV4::MemoryManager::allocate{Managed,Object} functions allocate
memory and write to it before the caller does a placement new to
construct an object in the same memory. The compiler considers these
writes before the constructor as "dead stores" and eliminates them.

The -fno-lifetime-dse compiler flag is added to disable this more
aggressive dead-store eliminiation optimization.

This is a temporary workaround until a proper solution is found.

Upstream-Status: Accepted

Task-number: QTBUG-55482
