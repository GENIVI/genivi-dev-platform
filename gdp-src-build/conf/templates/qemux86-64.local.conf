# Fixed size: 1,5 GB
#
# The reason behind the fixed size is because the "extra free space" is not
# enough when booting the image under qemu and we end up with a full disk.
#
# Why the extra overhead is created when booting qemu is currently unknown,
# but setting the size to 1,5 GB allocates some space to be able to grow as
# well.
#
# At the time of writing 1,5 GB root file-system size results in following:
#
#    /dev/root                 1.4G    729.0M    586.1M  55% /
