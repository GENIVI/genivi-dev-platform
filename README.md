# GENIVI Development Platform

This project uses submodules to pull in dependencies. 
It is therefore recommended to :

```bash
git clone --recursive <thisrepo> -b <branch>
```
where branch is (for example) koelsch, porter, minnowboard or raspberrypi2
Please check which branches are available, for example, the master branch is no longer maintained so if you use that you will not get support.

If you forgot the recursive option, try:
```bash
git checkout <branch>
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

To build:
```
source init.sh
```
and then follow instructions.

If you do anything more advanced you probably need to study
information on git submodules - they are a bit special to
work with...

One recommendation to improve usability a little: 
```bash
git config diff.submodule=log
```
