## genivi-dev-platform.git usage
------------------------------------

This project uses submodules to pull in layer dependencies.
It is advised to avoid using the --recursive option for the
initial clone. 'master' is the default branch.
```
git clone <thisrepo> -b <branch>
```
To initiate the build environment:
```
source init.sh $target
```
The current supported targets are qemux86-64, porter, raspberrypi2, minnowboard, silk.
Current this requires the use of the bash shell

The init.sh script handles the the $target specific bitbake configuration.
The $target templates can be found in gdp-src-build/templates, as well as common
configuration .inc files. init.sh also handles the relevant git submodule
initiation.

To build:
```
bitbake genivi-dev-platform
```

Please see the README in meta-genivi-dev for further information.
