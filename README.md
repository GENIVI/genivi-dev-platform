genivi-dev-platform.git usage
------------------------------------
This project uses submodules to pull in layer dependencies.
It is advised to avoid using the --recursive option for the
initial clone. 'master' is the default branch. Previous release
'maintenance' branches are also available. Note certain tags
may require a different set of usage instructions, please refer
to the relative README.

    git clone <thisrepo> -b <branch>

To initiate the build environment:

    source init.sh $target

The current supported targets are qemux86-64, porter, raspberrypi2, raspberrypi3,
minnowboard, silk and r-car-m3-starter-kit.
Currently this requires the use of the bash shell

The `init.sh` script handles the the `$target` specific bitbake configuration.
The `$target` templates can be found in gdp-src-build/templates, as well as common
configuration `.inc` files. `init.sh` also handles the relevant git submodule
initiation.

To build:

    bitbake genivi-dev-platform

Please see the README in meta-genivi-dev for further information.
